Thank you for visiting our website!","title":"Publications"},{"location":"corpus/","text":"M\u0101ori Loanwords on Twitter The M\u0101ori Loanword Twitter (MLT) Corpus is a diachronic corpus of nearly 3 million New Zealand English tweets, posted between 2008 and 2018. The data was collected by extracting tweets containing one or more terms from a list of 77 M\u0101ori words and phrases . We then used computational machine learning methods to clean up the raw data, because many of the tweets were not relevant to a New Zealand English context (for instance, the loanword Moana , meaning sea, is commonly used to refer to the Disney film/princess). The corpus consists of three key components: Raw Corpus : The original dataset, which includes many irrelevant (non-New Zealand English) tweets. Labelled Corpus : 3,685 tweets that were manually labelled as \"relevant\" or \"irrelevant\" and used as training data for our model. Processed Corpus : The final version of the corpus, containing only tweets that the model classified as relevant. Building the MLT Corpus Below is a visual representation of the steps involved in building the corpus. For further information, see our paper . Summary Statistics This table shows key stats for the different components of the MLT Corpus: Description Raw Corpus V2* Labelled Corpus Processed Corpus V2* Tokens (words) 70,964,941 49,477 46,827,631 Tweets 4,559,105 2,495 2,880,211 Tweeters (authors) 1,839,707 1,866 1,226,109 *Please note that these statistics differ from what is stated in the paper, because we later refined our classifier, opting for a Naive Bayes Multinomial model that considered both unigrams and bigrams. Word Vectors The following visualisations were created by training Word2Vec embeddings on the M\u0101ori Loanword Twitter (MLT) Corpus. Hyper-parameters were optimised by minimising the median ranking of a list of given word pairs. The vectors are projected into two-dimensional space using the t-SNE method. Aroha (love): Wh\u0101nau (family): Click to download all word vector plots (including other loanwords). Download the MLT Corpus Tweets in the MLT Corpus can be hydrated (downloaded from Twitter) using the code provided. The source code is adapted from Twitter's sample code for API v2 endpoints. Note: Many tweets in the corpus are no longer publicly available and, as such, cannot be downloaded. Please email David Trye if you would like access to the complete dataset. The speed at which you can download the corpus depends on the rate limit for your Twitter developer account (e.g. 300 or 900 requests per 15-minute window). If you exceed the allocated limit, a 429 'Too many requests' error will be returned. Apply for a Twitter developer account if you do not have one already. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. The code for hydrating the corpus uses requests==2.24.0 , which in turn uses requests-oauthlib==1.3.0 . You can install these packages as follows: pip install requests pip install requests-oauthlib Download and extract all files in the mlt folder. This folder contains four CSV files with the tweet IDs for different components of the corpus, as well as two Python scripts for downloading and formatting the data (namely, get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py and json_to_tsv.py ). Configure your API bearer token by running the following command in the terminal: export 'BEARER_TOKEN'=' your_bearer_token ' Run get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py from the terminal. python get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py output.json This will download the corpus in batches of 100 tweets. If you use the default settings, the script will download the Processed Corpus V2 (though you can change the FILENAME in the code to any of the other CSV files). The Process Corpus will take roughly 24 hours to run, as it will attempt to download 30,000 tweets (300 requests x 100 tweets) every 15 minutes: 2,880,211 tweets / 30,000 tweets = 96 fifteen-minute batches, and 96 x 15 = 1440mins = 24hrs. (By comparison, because there are only a few thousand tweets, the relevant and irrelevant labelled tweets will download almost instantly. The Raw Corpus V2 contains some 4.5m tweets and will take approximately 38hrs to download.) The resulting file, output.json , is only pseudo-JSON (each batch is separated by a line in the form \"Batch X , Code Y \", where X and Y are numbers). Run json_to_tsv.py to convert the output file to TSV format. python json_to_tsv.py This script will produce a file called mlt_corpus_download_ timestamp .csv , which you can then open in a spreadsheet application. Unfortunately, due to a Unicode formatting error, some characters will not be correctly displayed (note: they are still correct in the JSON file). For now, we indicate problematic characters with [unicode] , but this is only a temporary fix.

Hybrid Hashtags The Hybrid Hashtag (HH) Sub-Corpus is a subset of tweets in the MLT Corpus containing hashtags made up of M\u0101ori and English words (so-called \"hybrid hashtags\"). There are 81 hybrid hashtags in this dataset, used in 5,684 tweets and posted to Twitter by 3,771 distinct users. Popular hashtags include #waitangiday, #maorilanguageweek, #gokiwi, #proudkiwi, #kiwipride and #letssharegoodtereostories. Download the HH Sub-Corpus Click to download the HH Sub-Corpus .

English The Reo M\u0101ori Twitter (RMT) Corpus is a collection of 79,018 te reo M\u0101ori tweets, designed for linguistic analysis and to help in the development of new Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for the M\u0101ori community. The corpus captures output from 2,302 users, including a mixture of personal and institutional accounts. These users were identified via Prof. Kevin Scannell's Indigenous Tweets website . Download the RMT Corpus The tweets and user metadata in the RMT Corpus can be hydrated (downloaded from Twitter) using the code provided. The source code is adapted from Twitter's sample code for API v2 endpoints. Note: Some tweets in the corpus are no longer publicly available and, as such, cannot be downloaded. Please email David Trye if you would like access to the complete dataset, including additional metadata mentioned in our paper. The speed at which you can download the corpus depends on the rate limit for your Twitter developer account (e.g. 300 or 900 requests per 15-minute window). If you exceed the allocated limit, a 429 'Too many requests' error will be returned. Apply for a Twitter developer account if you do not have one already. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. The code for hydrating the corpus uses requests==2.24.0 , which in turn uses requests-oauthlib==1.3.0 . You can install these packages as follows: pip install requests pip install requests-oauthlib Download and extract all files in the rmt folder. This folder contains a file called rmt-corpus-v1.csv , which has the tweet IDs and selected metadata, as well as two Python scripts for downloading and formatting the data (namely, get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py and json_to_tsv.py ). Configure your API bearer token by running the following command in the terminal: export 'BEARER_TOKEN'=' your_bearer_token ' Run get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py from the terminal. python get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py output.json This will download the corpus in batches of 100 tweets. If you use the default settings, the script will take roughly 45 minutes to run, as it will attempt to download 30,000 tweets (300 requests x 100 tweets) every 15 minutes. The resulting file, output.json , is only pseudo-JSON (each batch is separated by a line in the form \"Batch X , Code Y \", where X and Y are numbers). Run json_to_tsv.py to convert the output file to TSV format. python json_to_tsv.py This script will produce a file called rmt-corpus-final.csv , which you can then open in a spreadsheet application. Tweet text is formatted consistently (special characters are removed, any HTML is decoded, and user mentions and links are standardised). The tweets are also supplemented with metadata from the original rmt-corpus-v1.csv file. A description of the variables in each of the CSV files is given below. Data Description: rmt-corpus-v1.csv The following information (where known) is supplied in rmt-corpus-v1.csv , even if the tweet is no longer available on Twitter. Data Column Description id Twitter's unique identifier for the tweet. You can search for a tweet online by visiting twitter.com/user/status/XXX , where XXX is the tweet's ID. num_maori_words The number of M\u0101ori words in the tweet. total_words The total number of words in the tweet. percent_maori The percentage of M\u0101ori text detected in the tweet (= num_maori_words / total_words *100). favourites The number of favourites (likes, retweets quotes) that the given tweet received. reply_count The number of replies that the given tweet received. user.alias An alias for the author of the tweet in the form T X , where X represents the user\u2019s ranking based on their total number of tweets in the corpus ( user.num_tweets ). user.status The account status (as of Decemeber 2020) of the user who wrote the tweet: 'active', 'protected', 'suspended' or 'not found'. user.followers The user's number of followers (as of December 2020). user.friends The number of accounts that the user follows (as of December 2020). user.num_tweets The total number of tweets in the corpus that were written by this user. user.region The user's location, based on self-reported information. Where possible, the data has been aggregated into New Zealand regions and names of foreign countries. year The year the tweet was written (between 2007 and 2020). Data Description: rmt-corpus-final.csv If the tweet is still publicly available on Twitter, the following variables will appear alongside those mentioned above. Missing values are indicated with 'None': Data Column Description content The tweet content, with consistent formatting applied (special characters stripped, user mentions and links standardised). content_with_emojis The tweet content with emojis included. conversation_id The ID for the conversation that the tweet is part of. in_reply_to_user_id If the tweet is written in reply to another, this is the ID of the user who who wrote the original tweet. author_id Twitter's unique identifier for the user who wrote the tweet. created_at The timestamp when the tweet was posted, in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.000Z . lang The two-letter code representing the language that the tweet was (erroneously) classified as (NOT M\u0101ori, as the API does not support te reo). source The device or third-party application from which the tweet was posted (e.g. 'Twitter Web Client', 'Twitter for iPhone'). error The reason why the tweet could not be downloaded, if there was an error ('Authorization Error', 'Not Found Error', 'None'). Other Resources Code for cleaning and analysing the RMT Corpus is available on the project GitHub repository . You can download a wordlist with frequencies for all words and hashtags in the corpus.

The source code is adapted from Twitter's sample code for API v2 endpoints. Note: Some tweets in the corpus are no longer publicly available and, as such, cannot be downloaded. Please email David Trye if you would like access to the complete dataset, including additional metadata mentioned in our paper. The speed at which you can download the corpus depends on the rate limit for your Twitter developer account (e.g. 300 or 900 requests per 15-minute window). If you exceed the allocated limit, a 429 'Too many requests' error will be returned. Apply for a Twitter developer account if you do not have one already. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. The code for hydrating the corpus uses requests==2.24.0 , which in turn uses requests-oauthlib==1.3.0 . You can install these packages as follows: pip install requests pip install requests-oauthlib Download and extract all files in the rmt folder. This folder contains a file called rmt-corpus-v1.csv , which has the tweet IDs and selected metadata, as well as two Python scripts for downloading and formatting the data (namely, get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py and json_to_tsv.py ). Configure your API bearer token by running the following command in the terminal: export 'BEARER_TOKEN'=' your_bearer_token ' Run get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py from the terminal. python get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py output.json This will download the corpus in batches of 100 tweets. If you use the default settings, the script will take roughly 45 minutes to run, as it will attempt to download 30,000 tweets (300 requests x 100 tweets) every 15 minutes. The resulting file, output.json , is only pseudo-JSON (each batch is separated by a line in the form \"Batch X , Code Y \", where X and Y are numbers). Run json_to_tsv.py to convert the output file to TSV format. python json_to_tsv.py This script will produce a file called rmt-corpus-final.csv , which you can then open in a spreadsheet application. Tweet text is formatted consistently (special characters are removed, any HTML is decoded, and user mentions and links are standardised). The tweets are also supplemented with metadata from the original rmt-corpus-v1.csv file.
