# Covid NZ Twitter Corpus 
The *Covid NZ Twitter (CovidNZT) Corpus* consists of 40,243 tweets obtained between 22 February and 10 November 2020 (1,001 of which have been manually coded). All tweets contain the hashtag #covid19nz, including variations with one or more capital letters. The aim of the project is to study linguistic strategies which tweeters use to express their viewpoints and stance in Covid-related tweets. In particular, one of our points of interests is the use of directives.
