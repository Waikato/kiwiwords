# Māori Words on Twitter

Code for building and analysing two different Twitter corpora: 
1. The <i>Reo Māori Twitter (RMT) Corpus V2</i> comprising 94,163 Māori language tweets. The first version of the corpus (reported in [our paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-022-09580-w)) contained 79,018 tweets.
2. The <i>Māori Loanword Twitter (MLT) Corpus</i> containing 4.5 million tweets of Māori loanwords in New Zealand English (NZE).

Code relating to the <i>Māori-English Twitter (MET) Corpus</i> is hosted on [another GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bilingual-MET/hybrid).
